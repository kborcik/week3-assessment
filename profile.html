<!-- Edit the file called profile.html. Make a profile about yourself.

The profile should feature your skills, interests, and career goals.
 Be creative and try practice using basic HTML elements like headings, 
 paragraphs, lists, and forms, as well as CSS concepts such as classes and flexbox.
Feel free to copy the head and nav components from the home.html
page so that your profile has the same look and feel as the other pages on the website. -->

        <h4>Career Goals</h4>
        <p> I'm currently interested in the inevitable change in the economy due to
             the acceleration of AI development. I believe its exponential growth will quickly become unmonitorable by human interaction.
              The choices made now concerning Ai must involve kindness, nuture, and benevolence and great care.
               I left my last careet in order to be a part of the AI conversation and hopefully add a tender voice to the mix.</p>
